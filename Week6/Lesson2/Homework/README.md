# Homework

## First

Get authentication working in Rewsly. This isn't due next week but you'll need it working to continue with our examples in upcoming weeks.

## Second

Write a list of data you might want to store about a user. Put it in a text file. Just a list of different User attributes you'd want in any application you would want to build. You'll find that some of the data you want to store about users overlaps with data from other models. This will then lead into model associations which we'll talk about next week.
