##Final Project user data

My final project will be a marketplace platform that lets people buy and sell businesses. 

There will be two types of users, buyers and sellers. 

For the end project, I may not have the concept of a seller spec'd out let, but I want buyers to be able to log in, browse some businesses, and ideally search for a few things they're interested, i.e. city or industry. 

Here's what will be on file about buyers (I already made this final project schema so I'm keeping my formatting)

    t.string   "first_name"
    t.string   "last_name"
    t.integer  "spend_limit"
    t.string   "city"
    t.string   "industry_interests"
    t.string   "gender"
    t.string   "email"
