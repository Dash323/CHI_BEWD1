BEWD: FINAL PROJECT
--------

#DESCRIPTION
For the final project you will use your knowledge of back-end web development to produce an awesome web application that can be used by friends, family or any of the other billions of people who use the Internet. You will choose the type of web application you’d like to create. Don’t worry; you have some time to think about what you would like to do.

The objective of this project is to:

- Demonstrate understanding of all topics covered during this course.

- Apply knowledge gained during this course by building a web application from the ground up.

The final encapsulates everything you’ve learned in this course. We want to make sure you are successful in your venture, so to stay on track we suggest you take our milestone suggestions seriously. In addition, we will help define scope and guide you through the process.


##CORE REQUIREMENTS
To pass projects must include:

- About page/or a detailed descript of your app.

- User accounts. Your application must utilize user accounts.

-   Security Features. Login credentials must be validated before users can gain access to your application. 

-   Hosted. No need to pay for hosting services, you can use GitHub and Heroku. 

-   Ruby Gems. Use a Ruby Gem (not the Rails defaults, obviously they don't count). Some ideas to look into: devise or paper clip, carrier wave.

-   Handles invalid data. Forms in your application should validate data and handle incorrect inputs. (i.e. validate sign up information, verify valid email addresses and secure passwords).

-   Make use of associations. At least two of your models should be associated.


Matt Carrington's proposal
==========================

I plan on building a reward based Ruby on Rails To-Do list app.

Users can sign up via their email address and create goal or to-do lists and specify a reward for completing the tasks. Users will recieve points by completing tasks. When the user has accumulated the points required, they can get their (self-generated) reward. 

The home page will have a sign-up/log in function along with a detailed description of the app (or a link to one). After logging in, users can create a new list/reward, view outstanding lists/rewards, remove lists/rewards, and navigate elsewhere. Users will also have an accomplishment page so they can view their past lists, rewards, and various other stats.

The app will check against invalid data upon sign-up and creation of new lists, list items, and reward items.

I still need to find a gem to use but I'm sure after searching, there will be something i can incorporate.
