##User Story 1:
I'm an entreprenuer who's not interested in founding my own business but would like to find different  businesses for sale in my chosen industry or city. I'm busy and small-scale, so I want a lot of the vetting done for me so I can make it easy to find my opportunities. 

##User Story 2: 
I'm a business owner who has built a decent business but I can no longer take the day-to-day stress of running it, so I want to find a good group of buyers who are serious about their commitment A) to purchase and B) to keep the business intact (it's my baby after all!)
