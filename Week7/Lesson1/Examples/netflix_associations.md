# Netflix associations

Get into 2 groups. Group 1 is the big huge table at the back of class and group 2 will be the 3 smaller tables that seat 2 people each.

Draw a diagram that shows the associations for the following Netflix database tables:

- Users
- Movies
- Genres (Let's say a movie can only have 1 genre)
- Reviews

*Include the model's foreign and primary keys.*
